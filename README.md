# Miniature-Chess
A C++ program allowing a user to play a game of miniature chess in a terminal.

I wrote this program during my CS202 class, and it was built with the help of abstract classes, dynamic memory management, and virtual functions. The program begins by allocating memory to create a chess board that is then populated with chess piece objects based on the piece type that is needed. From there, the game is played by having a user correctly type in a valid move based on the piece chosen, and it will end once a player has captured all of their opponent's pieces. 

Personally, this is my favorite program I have written because of its interactivity. I loved being able to witness my program slowly come alive in my terminal, and I enjoyed the ability to let anyone play this mini version of chess I created. Not only that, but I thought this program helped me improve my object-oriented programming due to how easy it was to imagine each individual chess piece as its own individual object.
