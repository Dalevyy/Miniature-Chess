# Miniature-Chess
A C++ program allowing a user to play a miniature chess game in a terminal.

I wrote this program during my CS202 class, and it was built with the help of abstract classes, dynamic memory management, and virtual functions. The chess game itself is made up of a pointer array with each chess piece actually being an object allocated in memory. Users moving chess pieces will actually be moving the object's memory location and any time a user takes a piece from the opposing player, the object will properly be deallocated from memory. 

This program is one of my favorites that I have written due to how interactive it is. I enjoyed making something that can actually be played by a real person. Not only that, but it wasn't too difficult to write since we did not have to worry about programming for the king.

This was a fun program.
